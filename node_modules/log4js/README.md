# log4js-node

This is a conversion of the [log4js](http://log4js.berlios.de/index.html) 
framework to work with [node](http://nodejs.org). I've mainly stripped out the browser-specific code
and tidied up some of the javascript. It includes a basic file logger, with log rolling based on file size. 

NOTE: since v0.2.0 require('log4js') returns a function, so you need to call that function in your code before you can use it. I've done this to make testing easier (allows dependency injection).

NOTE: I have disabled the console.log replacement which appeared in earlier versions, as console.log does some fancy formatting of output that log4js cannot handle. I don't want log4js breaking people's code mysteriously.


## installation

npm install log4js

## tests

Tests now use [vows](http://vowsjs.org), run with `vows test/*.js`. 

## usage

Minimalist version:
           var log4js = require('log4js')();
           var logger = log4js.getLogger();
           logger.debug("Some debug messages");
By default, log4js outputs to stdout with the coloured layout (thanks to [masylum](http://github.com/masylum)), so for the above you would see:
    [2010-01-17 11:43:37.987] [DEBUG] [default] - Some debug messages

See example.js:

    var log4js = require('log4js')(); //note the need to call the function
    log4js.addAppender(log4js.consoleAppender());
    log4js.addAppender(log4js.fileAppender('logs/cheese.log'), 'cheese');
    
    var logger = log4js.getLogger('cheese');
    logger.setLevel('ERROR');
    
    logger.trace('Entering cheese testing');
    logger.debug('Got cheese.');
    logger.info('Cheese is Gouda.');  
    logger.warn('Cheese is quite smelly.');
    logger.error('Cheese is too ripe!');
    logger.fatal('Cheese was breeding ground for listeria.');
  
Output
    [2010-01-17 11:43:37.987] [ERROR] cheese - Cheese is too ripe!
    [2010-01-17 11:43:37.990] [FATAL] cheese - Cheese was breeding ground for listeria.

  
## configuration

You can either configure the appenders and log levels manually (as above), or provide a 
configuration file (`log4js.configure('path/to/file.json')`) explicitly, or just let log4js look for a file called `log4js.json` (it looks in the current directory first, then the require paths, and finally looks for the default config included in the same directory as the `log4js.js` file). 
An example file can be found in `test/log4js.json`. An example config file with log rolling is in `test/with-log-rolling.json`
You can also pass an object to the configure function, which has the same properties as the json versions.

## todo

patternLayout has no tests. This is mainly because I haven't found a use for it yet, 
and am not entirely sure what it was supposed to do. It is more-or-less intact from 
the original log4js.

## connect/express logger

A connect/express logger has been added to log4js. This allows connect/express servers to log using log4js. See example-connect-logger.js. 

    var log4js = require('./lib/log4js')();
    log4js.addAppender(log4js.consoleAppender());
    log4js.addAppender(log4js.fileAppender('cheese.log'), 'cheese');
      
    var logger = log4js.getLogger('cheese');
    
    logger.setLevel('INFO');
    
    var app = require('express').createServer();
    app.configure(function() {
        app.use(log4js.connectLogger(logger, { level: log4js.levels.INFO }));
    });
    app.get('/', function(req,res) {
        res.send('hello world');
    });
    app.listen(5000);

The options object that is passed to log4js.connectLogger supports a format string the same as the connect/express logger. For example:

    app.configure(function() {
        app.use(log4js.connectLogger(logger, { level: log4js.levels.INFO, format: ':method :url' }));
    });
